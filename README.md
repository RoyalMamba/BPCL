# BPCL
Data cleaning and analysis project for bpcl stocks fetched via NASDAQ 
Introduction:
The purpose of this project is to analyze the stock price data of ___Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL)___ using Python. The data will be retrieved from data.nasdaq.com API and plotted using a plotting library such as Matplotlib or Seaborn.

Technology Requirements:
The Jupyter Notebook should be written in Python programming language. The stock price data should be retrieved using data.nasdaq.com API. The line graph should be generated using a plotting library such as Matplotlib or Seaborn.

Deliverables:
A completed Jupyter Notebook that meets the technology requirements outlined above. A brief summary of the findings and observations from the analysis of BPCL stock price data. All source code and supporting documentation necessary to run the Jupyter Notebook on a computer with Python and the required libraries installed. Instructions for Running the Jupyter Notebook:

Install the latest version of Python on your computer. Install the required libraries for the project, including Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib or Seaborn, and any other libraries required for API data retrieval. Download the project files from the source provided. Open the Jupyter Notebook file and run the cells one by one. The line graph of BPCL stock price data will be generated and displayed in the Notebook. Expected Outcome: After following the instructions above and running the Jupyter Notebook, a line graph of BPCL stock price data will be generated and displayed. The graph will show the trend of BPCL stock prices over time and provide insights into the stock performance.
